Avengers Infinity Code
-----------------------------------------------------

As you know Loki has opened Earth to a new dimension and He wants to rule The Earth, But the Avengers are trying to save the Earth.
To close the new dimension portal Iron man has to generate a positive Energy in form of Electricity say "E" which can be only digital i.e contains '1's and '0's .
As Iron man suit energy is low on power he has to generate the minimum energy required to destroy the portal to another dimension which have a protective field "F".
The energy generated "E" should be a divisible by the field of the portal "F" , so say if the field of the portal is 17 than iron man have to
generate minimum digital(0's & 1's) electric energy which is divisible by 17 i.e 11101.

As you are Jarvis you need to calculate the minimum energy to generate for breaking the portal
Jarvis, Please save the world.
